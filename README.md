# How to use:
Download the attached [executable .jar application](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Simple-Business-simulator-Application/blob/main/Business%20Simulator%20Java%20Program%20v1.0.jar) and execute and the java-based GUI will start-up. Alternately, the program can also be run by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Simple-Business-simulator-Application/tree/main/SourceCode) and compiling/executing each java class via a command line/IDE or the classes for the source code can be introduced into the Eclipse IDE and exported as a .jar executable.



## Simulator Description/Rules:

There are four user-intractable options that can be pursued
during the simulator. You as a business owner have the following options
available. You can remain passive(do nothing), buy inventory, put
inventory on sale, or train your employees. A cycle is an in-simulator unit
of time.
Putting items on sale accelerates the rate and amount of sales
and thefts. Training your employees increases your sales
marginally, however, the initial cost of training is $175 plus an
additional fifteen dollars per level. Employee pay also increases per
level.
Theft and random events may happen during rounds. You may also have
pleasant surprises, but that is not likely. Shoplifting and robbery are more
likely to happen to you because of the area that you are in (Just look at
your rent.)
Updates of all events (good, bad,& neutral) will happen during the cycle.
Don't worry about always keeping an inventory, you have been given a
semi-automatic service that auto-manages your inventory when it gets
low
(below 10 items). This service is free however if you drop below
0 items you will receive a $50 fee. So, you don't always need to buy
merchandise, but it certainly helps. Remember that every action (input)
you make will affect the way the simulation will unfold.
Each merchandise item is sold for $40 and purchased for $25.
Tip: consider your input to your outputs, something bringing more sales
but may cost more in the long run.
